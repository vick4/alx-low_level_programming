C - Doubly Linked Lists
Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming, specific to the C programming language: manipulating doubly linked lists by printing/inserting/deleting nodes, freeing nodes, and using the node data (e.g. to get a total sum)

Description of what each file shows:
lists.h .................. header file with structure defined and function prototypes
main_test_files.c ........ testing files for each corresponding file that starts with that number
Files that start with:
prints all the elements
returns the number of elements in linked list
adds a new node at the beginning
adds a new node at the end
frees linked list
returns the nth node
returns the sum of all the data in list
inserts a new node at a given position
deletes the node at index
